Q - What does the following code do?
  int i = 0;
  while (i < 10)
  {
    i += 1;
    std::cout << i << std::endl;
  }
  
 A - This program iterates through the variable i from 0 to 10.  
     Each iteration through the loop, i += 1 means i + i + 1. 
     After this, the program prints the value of i.
     
     Output is the following:
     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
     7
     8
     9
