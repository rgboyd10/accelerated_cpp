/*
Q - The average-grade computation in section 3.1/36 might divide by zero if the student didn't enter any grades.  Division by zero is undefined in C++, which means that the implementation is permitted to do anything it likes.  What does your C++ implementation do in this case?  Rewrite the program so that its behavior does not depend on how the implementation treats division by zero.
